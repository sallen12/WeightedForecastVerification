Description: R package that provides tools to evaluate probabilistic forecast with
    respect to particular outcomes. These outcomes can be weighted during forecast
    evaluation, using weighted scoring rules and conditional PIT histograms. This
    package provides three types of weighted scoring rules for forecast distributions
    in the form of normal and logistic distributions, as well as the functionality
    to implement rank and PIT histograms, PIT reliability diagrams, conditional PIT 
    histograms, and conditional PIT reliability diagrams for ensemble forecasts and 
    a range of parametric families. Reliability indices to measures the flatness
    of a histogram are also provided.
